A machine component experienced multiple deformations following extended usage.
Utilizing a sensor, the component&#39;s shape was digitally reconstructed and represented
as a collection of points that define its surface.
These points are stored in the file &quot;3d_shape_points_data.npz&quot;.
Your task is as follows:
- Determine the original shape of the object.
- Identify the deformations present in the component.
- Reconstruct the original shape by correcting the deformations.


Libraries Used
- Numpy : Used to load .npz flies that store the data in Array format
- MatplotLib : Plotting/vizualising graphs
- mpl_toolkits.mplot3d : Helper function to matplotlib to plot 3D objects
- skelear.decomposition PCA : To find the directions of variations
- open3d : Library used for handling/processing 3D points.

Process Followed
1. Loading the data points.
2. 3D plot [x,y,z] to initially visualize.
3. PCA to find the deviations of the axes.
4. Converting the visualized points to open3d's utility Array.
5. Removing outliers.
6. voxeling the size for proper view.


Prompts Used
1. Explain me in mathematical procedure of PCA considering an example. - To revamp the knowledge
2. Methods to remove noise using open3d or anyother methods for more better visualization.
